# Servo control using Ultrasound distance sensor

**Control of a servo motor with an ultrasonic sensor**

This is a project which aims at development of an interactive interface in which the movement of a hand (or another obstacle) can control a servo motor. The project can be extended to execute projects in robotic control and newer interfaces for musical expressions.

**Components:**
1. Arduino Uno
2. Jumper wires (male to male)
3. 16 X 2 display LCD
4. Ultrasonic Sensor HC SR-04
5. Arduino Servo Motor
6. USB Cable
7. Compatible laptop with Arduino sketch installed on it.

I am no longer updating the Robotic musicianship blog but it has some pretty cool stuff.
